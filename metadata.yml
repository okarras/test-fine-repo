name: FINE - A Framework for Integrated Energy System Assessment
description: >-
  The FINE python package provides a framework for modeling, optimizing and
  assessing energy systems. With the provided framework, systems with multiple
  regions, commodities and time steps can be modeled. Target of the optimization
  is the minimization of the total annual cost while considering technical and
  environmental constraints. Besides using the full temporal resolution, an
  interconnected typical period storage formulation can be applied, that reduces
  the complexity and computational time of the model.
